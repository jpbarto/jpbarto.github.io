1.  Overview & Definitions

Machine learning is..., Deep Learning is...., artificial intelligence is...., big data is...., data analytics is.... The purpose of this market is to identify mature machine learning framework that support a diverse list of machine learning algorithms. Purpose The purpose of this market analysis is to identify and evaluate the machine learning libraries and frameworks available for use with the Java programming language. Technical requirements

1.  Ability to work with Hadoop without Hadoop being required in order for the framework or library to function.
2.  Compatible with the Java programming language
3.  The library must be under active development

1.  Concepts
    1.  Learning Styles
        1.  **Unsupervised Learning**Ref 3, The opposite to supervised learning, with unsupervised learning the training data set is unlabeled, ie the algorithm is not informed of the desired output given the input.  The algorithm, in this case, is then left to deduce structures present in the data, extracting general rules.  The algorithm's mathematical process may systematically reduce redundancy or organize data by similarity.  Such algorithms are used to perform dimensionality reduction, clustering, and to develop association rules.  Examples of algorithms that are trained using unsupervised learning include the Apriori algorithm and k-means clustering.
        2.  **Supervised Learning**Ref 3, All training data given to the learning algorithm is labeled with the desired result for the data.  This label may identify an email as spam or non-spam, or an image as containing a face.  The algorithm will be trained with the collection of labeled inputs (inputs mapped to desired outputs) until the algorithm's outputs begin to match with the labeled training data to a desired level of accuracy.  Supervised learning is typically used to train algorithms to classify inputs or predict results based upon an input.  Examples of algorithms that are trained using supervised learning include Logistic Regression and Back Propagation Neural Network.
        3.  **Reinforcement Learning**Ref 4, Reinforcement learning is similar to unsupervised learning in that it uses unlabeled training data, however the algorithm is provided with a fitness equation, a mechanism by which it can calculate the quality of the result produced in response to the input.  The reinforcement signal generated by the performance measure can be fed back into the algorithm in order to produce better results in the future.
    2.  Algorithms
        1.  Clustering
        2.  **Regression**Ref 4, Regression models the relationship between variables using a measure of error in the predictions made by the model.  Popular as a style of algorithm within the field of statistics.  Some of the most popular regression algorithms are:
            1.  Ordinary Least Squares Regression
            2.  Linear Regressiongit
            3.  Logistic Regression
            4.  Stepwise Regression
            5.  Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines
            6.  Locally Estimated Scatterplot Smoothing
        3.  Classification
2.  Frameworks
    1.  Scikit-learn
    2.  Spark ML
